      <description>Disclaimer Before reading, you should only need to do this if you cannot use Plug and Play (PnP) from either yarn or pnpm. PnP does not have this issue as it loads modules that are stored as zip files. A single module that is zipped is just 1 file vs potentially 10s if not 100s of 1000s of files coming from each of your dependencies of dependencies of dependencies etc. etc.</description>
